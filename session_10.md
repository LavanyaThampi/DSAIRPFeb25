# Measures of Central Tendency
For summarizing and understanding data.
## Mean
The mean is the average of all the data points.

## Median
The median is the middle value in an ordered data set.
1. Arrange the data in ascending or descending order.
2. If the number of data points is odd, the median is the middle value.
3. If the number of data points is even, the median is the average of the two middle values.

## Mode
The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. The mode is higher bar in bar chart.
eg:
[5, 23, 6, 9, 5, 4, 9, 5]
mode = 5

## Percentile
A percentile indicates the value below which a given percentage of data falls.
For example, the 25th percentile (also called the first quartile, Q1) is the value below which 25% of the data lies.
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] the 25th percentile is 3.

## Quartiles(Q1, Q2, Q3)
Quartiles divide the data into four equal parts:
1. Q1 (First Quartile): The median of the lower half of the data (25th percentile).
2. Q2 (Second Quartile): The median of the entire data set (50th percentile).
3. Q3 (Third Quartile): The median of the upper half of the data (75th percentile).

1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

Q1 = 3 
Q2 = 5.5
Q3 = 8

## Interquartile range
The IQR measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data.
Calculation: IQR = Q3 - Q1
Eg: 
For the data set above, IQR = 8 - 3 = 5.

## Min
The minimum (min) is the smallest value in a data set.
Eg:
2,4,6,8, the min is 2.
## Max
The maximum (max) is the largest value in a data set.
eg:
2,4,6,8, the max is 8.
