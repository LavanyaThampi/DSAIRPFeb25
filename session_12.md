Practice Problems on Vectors and Matrices
1. Basic Concepts of Scalars and Vectors
Identify which of the following quantities are scalars and which are vectors:

(a) Temperature
(b) Velocity
(c) Force
(d) Distance
A force F = (3, -4) N is applied to an object. What is the magnitude of this force?

2. Vectors in Abstract Spaces
Given two vectors in 3D space:

Find:

(a) Their sum a + b
(b) Their difference a - b
(c)
