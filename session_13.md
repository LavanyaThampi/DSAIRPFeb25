# Frequentist definition of probability
# Law of Large numbers
1. The law of large numbers states that the more experiments we run, the closer we will tend to get tot the expected probability
# Events and Sample Spaces
1. Coin Toss example
2. Dice throwing example
# Dependent and Independent Events
# Joint probability
# Marginal Probability
# Conditional Probability
1. Similarity to Hypothesis testing
# Bayes theorem
1. Prior
2. Likelihood
3. Posterior
# Difference between conditional probability and Bayes theorem
# Expected value
# Essense of Information theory
1. Quantifying uncertainity
2. Entropy
3. Entropy curve calculation
4. Cross entropy
# Problem 1: Medical Test Accuracy
A certain disease affects 1% of population. A test of the disease is 99% accurate meaning
1. If a person has the disease the test will be positive 99%
2. If the person does not have disease, the test will be negative 99%
P(D): Probability of person has disease P(T) : Probablity of test is positive
P(D) = 0.01
P(D′) = 1-$P(D)$ = 1-0.01 = 0.99
P(T|D) = 0.99
P(T′D′) = 0.99
P(T|D′) = 1-$P(T|D)$ = 1-0.99 = 0.01
Find P(D|T) and P(D|T′)
# Problem 2: Spam Email Classification
Suppose and email is classified as spam if it contains the word "money". Past statistics show:
1. 5% of all emails are spam
2. 2% non-spam emails contains the word money
3. 60% spam emails contains the word money
Find P(Spam|money) and P(Spam|money′)
# Problem 3 : Sample Space
1. List the sample space for tossing two coins
2. What is the sample space for rolling two dice?
3. How many possible outcomes exist in selecting a card from a standard deck of 52 playing cards?
4. If an experiment consists of flipping a coin and rolling a die, what is the total number of outcomes?
# Problem 4 :Dependent and Independent Events**
1. A bag contains 4 red balls and 6 blue balls. If you pick one ball and then another with replacement, are the events independent or dependent?
# Problem 5: Joint and Marginal Probability**
1. A dataset shows that 40% of customers purchase Product A, 25% purchase Product B, and 15% purchase both. What is the probability that a customer purchases at least one product?
# Problem 6: Expected Value**
1. A lottery ticket costs ₹10 and has a 1% chance of winning ₹500. What is the expected value of the ticket?**
# Problem 7: Entropy & Information Theory**
1. What is the entropy of a fair coin toss?**
