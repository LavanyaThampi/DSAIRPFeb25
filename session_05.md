# Demystifying Terms Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence
## Artificial Intelligence
-Artificial Intelligence is the broad field of creating systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks can include things like understanding natural language, recognizing images, making decisions, or playing games. AI encompasses multiple technologies, including Machine Learning.
-AI systems are created to imitate human cognitive abilities, such as reasoning and perception, and can be utilized across different industries like healthcare, finance, entertainment, and others.
An example of AI is a virtual assistant like Siri or Alexa.
-These AI systems can understand spoken language, interpret instructions, and carry out tasks like setting reminders, playing music, or answering questions. They utilize natural language processing and machine learning to enhance their ability to recognize speech patterns and provide more accurate responses as they learn.
-It refers to a type of AI that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, much like a human. 
## Artificial General Intelligence
-Artifficial General Intelligence aims to perform any intellectual task that a human can do. It has the ability to plan, solve complex problems, and adapt to new situations, with general learning capabilities across multiple domains.
-eg: self driving car
## History of Artificial Intelligence
i) 1940-1950-> Alan Turing -> proposed the concept of a machine that could simulate any human intelligence, which became known as the Turing Machine. Also introduced the Turing Test, a method to determine if a machine could exhibit intelligent behavior.
ii) 1950->John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and others coined the term "Artificial Intelligence".
iii) 1956-> Birth of AI
iv) 1960-1970-> ELIZA -a chatbot created by Joseph Weizenbaum and SHRDLU - a program that could understand simple commands in a block world.
v) 1980-> The backpropagation algorithm in neural networks to  allowing systems to learn from data and improve over time.
vi) 1990-> IBM developed Deep Blue.
vii) 2000-> Machine learning algorithms became more sophisticated, with the rise of support vector machines and decision trees.
Companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon began using AI to improve services like search, recommendations, and advertisements.
viii) 2010-> Development of Deep Learning.
ix) 2020-> AI became increasingly integrated into daily life with applications in autonomous vehicles, healthcare, robotics, finance, entertainment, education and more.
Advances in transformer models, like GPT-3 and BERT, allowed for more advanced language understanding and generation.
### Perceptron
Perceptron is a type of linear classifier used for binary classification tasks. It will classify input data into one of two possible classes.
Structure of Perceptron:-
Input layer: The perceptron receives the input features like data points.
Weights: Each input has an associated weight that determines its importance.
Activation function: After the weighted sum of inputs is calculated, an activation function is used to produce the output.
Limitations:-
A single perceptron can only solve linearly separable problems i.e,problems where the two classes can be separated by a straight line or hyperplane, It cannot handle more complex patterns or non-linear separations.

## Key Deciding Factors of Growth of AI
## Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
-Data Science is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting vast amounts of data to help inform decisions. It combines a variety of fields, like statistics, computer science, and domain expertise, to extract meaningful insights from data.

-Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. A machine learning model enhances its performance by learning from data, Rather than being directly programmed to carry out particular tasks.

-Artificial Intelligence is the broad field of creating systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks can include things like understanding natural language, recognizing images, making decisions, or playing games. AI encompasses multiple technologies, including Machine Learning.
