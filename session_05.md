## Key Deciding Factors of Growth of AI
## Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform specific tasks, a machine learning model improves its performance by learning from data.
Artificial Intelligence is the broad field of creating systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks can include things like understanding natural language, recognizing images, making decisions, or playing games. AI encompasses multiple technologies, including Machine Learning.
